abstract = {Background Although MRI can discriminate the lipid core from the collagenous cap of atherosclerotic lesions in vitro with T2 contrast, it has not yet produced detailed in vivo images of these human plaque components.  Methods and Results We imaged seven lesions from six patients who required surgical carotid endarterectomy and calculated T2 in vivo before surgery in various plaque regions. Using the same acquisition parameters, we repeated these measurements in vitro on the resected fragment and compared MR images with histology. T2 values calculated in vivo correlate with in vitro measurements for each plaque component; the in vitro discrimination we demonstrated previously with T2 contrast can therefore be performed similarly in vivo.  Conclusions MRI is the first noninvasive imaging technique that allows the discrimination of lipid cores, fibrous caps, calcifications, normal media, and adventitia in human atheromatous plaques in vivo. This technique also characterizes intraplaque hemorrhage and acute thrombosis. This result may support further investigations that include MRI of plaque progression, stabilization, and rupture in human atherosclerosis.

abstract = {Synthetic yet realistic images are valuable for many applicationsin visual sciences and medical imaging. Typically, investigators developalgorithms and adjust their parameters to generate images that are visuallysimilar to real images. In this study, we used a genetic algorithm and anobjective, statistical similarity measure to optimize a particular texturegeneration algorithm, the clustered lumpy backgrounds (CLB) technique,and synthesize images mimicking real mammograms textures. Wecombined this approach with psychophysical experiments involving thejudgment of radiologists, who were asked to qualify the visual realism ofthe images. Both objective and psychophysical approaches show that theoptimized versions are significantly more realistic than the previous CLBmodel. Anatomical structures are well reproduced, and arbitrary largedatabases of mammographic texture with visual and statistical realism canbe generated. Potential applications include detection experiments, wherelarge amounts of statistically traceable yet realistic images are needed.},
