First of all, I would like to thank my parents Martha Bernal and Jesus Prieto. 
They made the choice of adoption and they gave me the best they could. 
They taught me important values and made me the person that I am today. 

To Assoc. Prof. Chantal Muller, who gave me the opportunity to work 
on this project and trusted me from the beginning.
I wish her the best.

It has been a privilege to work with Prof. Steve Pizer.
Thanks to all the discussions we had, the most important contribution 
on this dissertation was achieved. 

To Prof. Christophe Odet for his support during this thesis.

I would like to thank the rest of my thesis committee: 
Assoc. Prof. Martin Styner, Prof. Christian Germain, Prof. David Rousseau, Prof. Fran\c{c}ois Cotton and MD. Charles Guttmann, 
for their feedback and comments.

A warm thought to my friends in Lyon and Chapel Hill 
for all the good moments we had during this PhD.

Finally, I would like to thank Aur\'elie Nguyen for her patience 
and for taking care of me when I was writing this manuscript.
